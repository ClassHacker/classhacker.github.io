Merge

react-animations also exports a merge function that takes two animations 
and returns a new animation that combines the transforms from both. 
This is experimental and wont work (well) with animations that have 
conflicting transforms, such as fadeIn and fadeOut. The merged animation 
can be used just like any of the imported animations.


import { merge, tada, flip } from 'react-animations';
const tadaFlip = merge(tada, flip);
